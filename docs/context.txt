Development Assessment
Let's build the future together
First of all: thank you  We've received a lot of portfolios and honestly,
the level is impressive. So we're using this short coding assessment to
help us choose the right fit.
This is not about perfection. It's about vision, technical approach,
originality, and how you think as a developer.
The work you'll do here is real. The winning code will actually be used by
the company and the developer behind it will join us full-time.
ö The Assessment (Build a SaaS Directory Submission Agent)
Build an automated SaaS directory submission system that submits your SaaS to hundreds of directories without manual work.
Company website: www.genie-ops.com
What It Does
The system:
Opens directory websites
Fills submission forms
Uploads your SaaS info
Submits listings
Tracks submission status
Repeats this across many sites
Result: You save dozens of hours and scale distribution.
Core Workflow
Directory List → Open Website → Detect Form → Fill SaaS Data → Submit → Save Status (Submitted / Pending / Approved)
Simple Architecture
Layer 1 — AI Form Reader (Brain)
Purpose: Understand page layout and detect form fields (name, URL, description, email)
Examples:
Browser-use
Agentic Browser
Vision-based LLM agents
Layer 2 — Browser Automation (Hands)
Purpose: Actually click and type
Tools:
Playwright (recommended)
Selenium
Handles:
Navigation
Input fields
Button clicks
File uploads
Layer 3 — Workflow Manager (Control Center)
Purpose: Run submissions at scale
Tool: schedule Python Library
Manages:
Directory queue
Retry failed submissions
Save logs
Track success rate
Input Data (One-Time Setup)
You provide:
SaaS name
Website URL
Description
Category
Logo
Contact email
List of directory URLs
Output Dashboard
Tracks:
Submitted sites
Pending approvals
Approved listings
í Technical Direction (Very Important)
We are looking for:
Clean, maintainable code
Smart automation logic
Scalable architecture
Creative problem-solving (even bold approaches)
Technical Requirements
ReactJs + FastAPI + Playwright/Selenium + PostgreSQL
LLM API KEY (you can use any LLM based on the use case for form detection)
This is not a coding tutorial exercise.
This is about translating a vision into working code.
⏳ Timeline
ö Deadline: Next Friday
m Decision: Friday
  Start date: If all goes well - next Monday
a What Happens Next?
The developer whose work stands out the most will:
Join us full-time
See this code shipped and used
Become the technical pillar of the company
No code thrown away.
No <test that goes nowhere=.
This is real.
Final Thought
This is not a "magic submit everywhere" tool.
It's a scalable submission assistant.
Used correctly:
Saves time
Increases distribution
Supports SEO strategy
Used blindly:
Creates spam footprint
Risks domain trust
